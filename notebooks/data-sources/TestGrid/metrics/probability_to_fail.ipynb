    "# Probability To Fail\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key performance indicators that we would like to create greater visibility into and for a given moment in time, is to calculate what is the probability that a given test will fail. Using this information, we plan to build a model that uses the probability to fail to predict the time to failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide maxium flexibility for the end-user of this work, instead of creating a number of dataframes to answer each of these specifc questions, we will define a long and narrow data structure (a list of tuples saved as a csv for now) that contains only 7 columns (\"timestamp\", \"tab\",\"grid\",\"test\",\"test_duration\", \"pass_or_fail\", \"prob\"). This allows visualization tools like Superset (or pandas) to perform the last filter and/or aggregate interested columns to an end user. Which is to say, there may be a lot of repetition within the final data set, but each row should be unique, and it should provide the simplest usability for an end-user. \n",

    "### Calculate Probability to Fail using SVM and Calibrated Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the probability to fail, some of the approaches we could consider are SVM (support vector machines) and a Calibrated Classification Model. In this section of the notebook, we will compare the SVM and Calibrated Classification model, and choose the model giving better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N — the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points. SVM is a good candidate model to calibrate because it does not natively predict probabilities, meaning the probabilities are often uncalibrated. The probabilities are not normalized, but can be normalized when calling the `calibration_curve()` function by setting the `normalize` argument to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SVM model can be created using the [scikit learn module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification predictive modeling problem requires predicting or forecasting a label for a given observation. An alternative to predicting the label directly, a model may predict the probability of an observation belonging to each possible class label. Although a model may be able to predict probabilities, the distribution and behavior of the probabilities may not match the expected distribution of observed probabilities in the training data. The distribution of the probabilities can be adjusted to better match the expected distribution observed in the data. This adjustment is referred to as calibration, as in the calibration of the model or the calibration of the distribution of class probabilities.\n",

    "A classifier can be calibrated using the [CalibratedClassifierCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV.html) sci-kit library. We will generate the labels/classes required for classification and train the model on a subset of the data set."

    "In this notebook, we calculated for a given moment in time, what is the probability that a test will fail. Using this information, we plan to build a model that uses the probability to fail value to predict the time to failure, that is how many days, weeks, months, hours, minutes or seconds do you have until the test in question stops working. As next steps, we plan to work on this [issue](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ocp-ci-analysis/issues/226)."
